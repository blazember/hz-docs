== Too many open files

Since Tiered Storage is backed by files on the disk, it increases the open file descriptor count of the operating system by the number of files it uses.
When Tiered Storage reports "too many open files", the open file descriptors in the operating system reached the maximum open file descriptors setting.
In this case, Tiered Storage can't open more files, and it may fail to read or write data from, or to the disk.
Failed writes retry until they succeed to guarantee consistency of the internal state of Tiered Storage, but reads may get reported to the client.

By default, every map with Tiered Storage enabled, and every configured index of these maps use 128 files at maximum.
